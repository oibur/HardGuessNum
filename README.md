# HardGuessNum

New and Improved.

Instead of choosing whether you want to guess the computer's number, or have the computer guess your number...
    -You and the computer take turns guessing each other's number to see who can guess it first. 

Instead of the given range always having 1-10000...
    -As you guess numbers the range adjusts appropriately. 
    -i.e. first choice is 7800, which is too low, the range is now 7800-10000.'

Instead of the computer guessing randomly, which could result in over 10000 guesses for 1-10000...
    -The computer will always choose half way between the range, elminating half the reamaining possibilities
    -For 1-10000 the computer will typically guess the number between 10-13 turns tops.
